# keyboard shortcut stuff:
# sometimes shortcuts get "bound" to stuff that doesn't show up in the settings gui
# this is super annoying b/c the gui WILL still let you set them but they just wont do anything
# use dconf editor which has much more comprehensive shortcuts and find the shortcut that 
# doesn't work and unset it there
# /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings (window switch directly)

#using grep as a test to do things
#grep -qi string file.txt && do something for matches
#grep -qi string file.txt || do something for misses

# installing FEH...
# 1. had to install expat from source (to set docbook_to_man)
# DOCBOOK_TO_MAN = "/home/kessler/.linuxbrew/Cellar/docbook2x/0.8.8_1/bin/db2x_manxml"
# 2. then had to install imlib2 from source (brew installs without_x)
# (also had to include flag --without-x-shm-fd, otherwize feh would never open window on rhino)
# 3. remember to set prefix = HOME/Cellar/pkg/version; brew link pkg;
# 4. brew install feh
# 
#
# due to bug (https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/102)
# brew install
#
